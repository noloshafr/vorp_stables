Thank you for buying our script ! for more scripts please visit https://discord.gg/6sARP6X3KH
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL:

Make sure you run the sql
-------------------------------------------------------------------
export:

included is a horse item script. inside it is an example on how to make more horse items. 

TriggerEvent('syn:exp', Horse , Number to increase horse exp) 
this export can be added to any of your existing horse items to increase horse exp 
an example of how this works would be like this 

local horse = GetMount(PlayerPedId()) -- this gets the horse the player is riding 
local exp = 5 -- increase the exp by 5 
TriggerEvent('syn:exp', Horse , exp) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

in the config you can change all the language ! no need to edit client at all, meaning if i make updates and i dont mention
the config u would not need to change the config at all thus saving all your language changes.

Stable shop is written in HTML and JAVA meaning you have to edit its language in those files. it is very unlikely that 
i will update this html meaning once you set your language u wouldnt have to replace those files on update unless i mention it !
be very careful when editing the language on those files and always make sure u have a backup ! a small mistake could break it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Horse Trainers:

in config there is an option for the horse trainer job. it is set as horsetrainer by default. if a player has this job
in the database all actions that increase the horse exp increase it by double the value. 

in the config you can set the amount of horses a trainer can have in their stable. this means horse trainers can have more horse slots than the normal players
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Stable Slots:

You can set the stable slots allowed for players in the config you can set horse slots and wagon slots

you can also set a seperate slot limit for players with the horse trainer job 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Horse levels: 

horses level up when a player interacts with them by leading them, riding them or using items with the above mentioned trigger. 

the horse items script i included already has those triggers set up so if you are running it and you use one of the items mentioned in it the exp will increase based 
on the value you set in it. 

horse trainers gain double the exp for the horses they interact with. 

horse training level is consistent and works no matter the rider of the horse. 

horse levels are a total of 4 just like the base game 

level 1 is the normal level all horses are spawned naturally in (untrained)

level2 allows you to do the rear trick by holding ALT button then pressing Space. if the horse is yours it will do the trick otherwise it will throw you
if your horse is less than level 2 and you try this trick the horse will buck you. 

level3 allows you to do the drift trick when riding hold CTRL and press space bar and you will drift. 

level4 allows you to make your horse dance by holding the space button either while standing still or moving. you can move the horse left and right as it dances 

horse levels also allow you to do some horse tricks using /commands

you can change these commands in the config as you like just make sure u write them as a command is written with no space. 

/horserest and /horsesleep work with level 2. they make the horse sit or sleep. these commands wont work if you are too close to your horse as it will stand up 
/horsedrink works with level 3 and it will allow your horse to drink water from a river and recover some stamina core. this command will only work if the horse is in water
/horsewallow is a cute trick your horse can do at level 4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Stables:
in the horse shop you can buy horses or wagons using gold or cash. 
you can rotate horses to see them better
horse tack items are free since they are just cosmatic 
you can look at all your horses and select your active horse here
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Horse/Wagon interactions:

H calls your horse, J calls your wagon. you can set the distance which the horse or wagon will spawn from the player in the config. 

pressing U near your horse or wagon will give you a menu where you can interact with the horse. you can see its name, open the inventory, dismiss it,
 or give its ownership to another player,

giving your horse or wagon ownership away to another player means that player owns them. this only works if the other player has empty slots in their stable. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Horse/Wagon inventory:

the horse/wagon inventory works for weapons,items. 
you can set the limit of item count the player can have in their horse/wagon inventory in the config.
